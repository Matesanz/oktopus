•
In many European markets, the extended de-
stocking cycle has led to distributor 
inventories below historical levels. 
Replenishments start only slowly and with 
regard to limited end-user demand in order to 
avoid inventory gaps. Market participants 
remain hesitant due to uncertainties on future 
demand and prices.
•
The share of EU cold-rolled imports from 
third countries remained stable at 23% in Q3 
2023 and was below the historical levels. The 
start of the anti-circumvention investigation 
against Taiwan, Vietnam, and Turkey created 
additional disadvantages for imports.
