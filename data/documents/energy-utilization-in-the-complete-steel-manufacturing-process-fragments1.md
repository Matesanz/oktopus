# Energy Utilization in the Complete Steel Manufacturing Process

## Coking
The coking process, where coal is transformed into coke, requires significant heat. This is typically achieved through burning coal or gas, consuming a large amount of thermal energy. The coking ovens are heated to temperatures around 1,000 to 2,000 degrees Celsius.

## Sintering and Pelletizing
Both sintering and pelletizing involve heating the iron ore to prepare it for the blast furnace. This heating process consumes substantial thermal energy, often derived from burning fossil fuels like coal or natural gas.

## Blast Furnace Ironmaking
The blast furnace is one of the most energy-intensive parts of steel production. It requires large quantities of thermal energy to reach the high temperatures (about 2,000 degrees Celsius) necessary to melt iron ore. This energy is typically provided by the burning of coke. Additionally, hot air (often preheated) is blown into the furnace, further increasing energy consumption.
