January–September 2023 compared to 
January–September 2022
During January–September 2023, Outokumpu’s sales 
decreased to EUR 5,447 million (EUR 7,598 million) 
and adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 445 million 
(EUR 1,146 million). The market environment, 
especially in Europe, was significantly weaker in 2023 
compared to the previous exceptionally strong year. 
ROCE for the rolling 12 months was  5.3% (26.8%). 
In January–September 2023 total stainless steel 
deliveries were 12% lower compared to the same 
period last year. Weaker profitability was mainly driven 
by substantially lower realized prices for stainless steel 
in Europe while there was a decrease in Americas as 
well. Also, the lower ferrochrome sales price negatively 
impacted profitability in 2023. Variable costs decreased 
mainly due to the fact that the negative impact from the 
higher electricity price was more than offset by the 
lower ferrosilicon price. Raw material-related inventory 
and metal derivative losses amounted to EUR 45 
million in January–September 2023 (losses of EUR 83 
million). Other operations and intra-group items' 
adjusted EBITDA totaled EUR -4 million (EUR -33 
million). EBIT amounted to EUR 214 million (EUR 961 
million) and net result EUR 131 million (EUR 775 
million) in January–September 2023.
