Basis of preparation
This interim report is unaudited. It has been prepared on 
a going concern basis. The same accounting policies 
and methods of computation have been followed when 
preparing the financial information as in the financial 
statements for 2022, with the exception of new and 
amended standards applied from the beginning of 2023. 
These amendments did not have a material impact on 
Outokumpu’s consolidated financial statements.
All presented figures in this report have been rounded 
and, consequently, the sum of individual figures can 
deviate from the presented figure. Key figures have been 
calculated using exact figures.
The sales, earnings, and working capital of Outokumpu 
are subject to seasonal variations as a result of, for 
example, industry demand, the number of working days, 
and vacation periods.  
Management judgment and the use of 
estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS requires management to make 
judgments as well as estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and 
the disclosure of contingent assets and contingent 
liabilities at the reporting date, as well as the reported 
amounts of income and expenses during the reporting 
period.
Although these estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of the circumstances at the end of the 
reporting period, actual outcomes may differ from the 
estimates and assumptions.
Discontinued operations - Long Products 
businesses
On July 12, 2022, Outokumpu announced that it had 
signed an agreement to divest the majority of the Long 
Products business operations to Marcegaglia Steel 
Group. The transaction includes melting, rod, and bar 
operations in Sheffield, the UK, bar operations in 
Richburg, the US, and wire rod mill in Fagersta, Sweden. 
The transaction excludes Outokumpu Long Products AB 
units in Degerfors and Storfors, Sweden. Long Products’ 
activities that remain in Outokumpu are included in Other 
operations.
As of September 2022, Outokumpu reclassified its Long 
Products businesses to be divested as assets held for 
sale and reported the businesses as discontinued 
operations according to IFRS 5 Non-current assets held 
for sale and discontinued operations. All figures in this 
interim report concern continuing operations unless 
otherwise stated. 
The divestment was completed on January 3, 2023, and 
the transaction was carried out as a share sale.
The total consideration for the transaction on a debt and 
cash-free basis was EUR 228 million. Provisional cash 
proceeds for the equity and net debt item were EUR 224 
million, with EUR 5 million paid into an escrow account. 
The transaction costs in total are EUR 8 million and are 
presented in the net result for the period from 
discontinued operations. 
The received proceeds, net of cash disposed, were EUR 
100 million. The gain on divestment reported in the net 
result from discontinued operations was EUR 5 million, 
mainly as the accumulated translation differences were 
reclassified into net result at the time of the divestment. 
The consideration is still subject to the release of the 
escrow account. In 2022, Outokumpu recognized in the 
net result from the discontinued operations an 
impairment loss of EUR 33 million.
On April 1, 2023, Outokumpu announced that it had 
signed an agreement to divest the remaining Long 
Products operations in Degerfors and Storfors, Sweden 
to Cogne Acciai Speciali, a world leader in the 
production of long stainless steels and nickel alloys 
based in Italy. 
On August 1, 2023, Outokumpu announced that it has 
completed the divestment of the remaining Long 
Products business in Sweden. Outokumpu's plate 
operations in Degerfors are not affected by the 
divestment. The enterprise value of the transaction is 
EUR 12 million and it has a positive cash impact for 
Outokumpu. Outokumpu booked a loss of EUR 26 
million in the third quarter.
Acquisition of FPX Nickel
In May 2023, Outokumpu signed an agreement to 
become a shareholder in the Canadian company, FPX 
Nickel Corp. with an ownership share of 9.9%. The 
amount of the investment is EUR 11 million. This equity 
investment is classified as fair value through other 
comprehensive income. The ownership is reported on 
level 1. The premium paid over the share's market price 
at the acquisition date has been treated as part of the 
inventory and will be released at the time of the nickel 
purchase.
