The Casual Chain Decomposition model is not limited to retrospective analysis but is also used in forecasting energy demand. By using causal models that integrate both internal and exogenous explanatory variables, the model facilitates the identification of trends and outliers. This is particularly valuable in companies of specific sectors, like automotive washing solutions, where understanding and anticipating energy demands is crucial.

In conclusion, the Causal Chain Decomposition Model has demonstrated its versatility and effectiveness in various studies. For example, it has been used in analyzing the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the iron and steel industry in China, as well as in more technical applications like genetic programming to decouple irrigation systems and paper transport processes. It is an integral tool for understanding the complex relationship between economic growth and energy consumption, with practical applications in various industries and research studies.
