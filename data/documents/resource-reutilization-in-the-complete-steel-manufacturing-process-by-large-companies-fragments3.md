## Utilization of Byproduct Gases in Direct Reduced Iron (DRI)
In processes like DRI, which is used for producing iron from ore using natural gas, the byproduct gases can be captured and reused as a fuel source in other parts of the manufacturing process or for electricity generation.

## Advanced Waste Management Techniques
Companies are adopting sophisticated waste management techniques to ensure efficient sorting, recovery, and recycling of various materials, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills.

## Efficient Use of Raw Materials
Through precision in manufacturing processes and advanced technologies, companies are maximizing the efficient use of raw materials, reducing waste and improving yield.

### Conclusion
    By implementing these strategies, large steel companies are not only reducing their environmental footprint but also improving their operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This approach reflects a growing trend in the industry towards sustainability and responsible resource management.
