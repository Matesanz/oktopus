Share buyback program
On November 3, 2022, Outokumpu's Board of Directors 
approved a share buyback program of up to EUR 100 
million. The maximum number of shares to be 
repurchased under the program was 20 million, 
representing approximately 4.4% of the company’s total 
number of shares. The program commenced on 
November 7, 2022, and ended on March 24, 2023.
During the program, Outokumpu repurchased a total of 
19,836,205 of its own shares and used a total of EUR 
100 million for the share repurchases. The average price 
per share was approximately EUR 5.04. After the 
completion of the program, Outokumpu held a total of 
23,109,206 treasury shares, representing 5.06% of the 
company’s total number of shares.
Through the share buyback program, Outokumpu aims 
to mitigate and manage the dilutive impact of the 
company’s outstanding convertible bonds. The 
repurchased shares are initially held by Outokumpu as 
treasury shares and may be used to meet its obligations 
under the convertible bonds. Alternatively, Outokumpu 
may decide to cancel any or all of the repurchased 
shares and reduce its capital accordingly.
