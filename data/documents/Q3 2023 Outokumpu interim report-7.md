Divestment of the Long Products 
business
On July 12, 2022, Outokumpu announced that it had 
signed an agreement to divest the majority of its Long 
Products business operations to Marcegaglia Steel 
Group, a leading global industrial group in the steel 
processing sector. Outokumpu will focus on its core 
business of flat stainless steel and ferrochrome.
The prerequisites for the completion of the transaction 
were, among other things, the necessary approvals by 
the competition authorities. Outokumpu announced 
these approvals on December 14, 2022. 
On January 3, 2023, Outokumpu announced that it had 
completed the divestment. The transaction was carried 
out as a share sale and, as a result of the transaction, 
melting, rod, and bar operations in Sheffield, the UK, bar 
operations in Richburg, the US, and wire rod mill in 
Fagersta, Sweden, were sold to Marcegaglia. The 
transaction excluded Outokumpu Long Products AB 
units in Degerfors and Storfors, Sweden.
The total consideration for the transaction on a debt and 
cash-free basis was EUR 228 million. Provisional cash 
proceeds for the equity and net debt item were EUR 224 
million, with EUR 5 million paid into an escrow account. 
The transaction costs in total were EUR 8 million and are 
presented in the net result for the period from 
discontinued operations. 
The received proceeds, net of cash disposed, were EUR 
100 million. The gain on divestment reported in the net 
result from discontinued operations was EUR 5 million, 
mainly as the accumulated translation differences were 
reclassified into net result at the time of the divestment. 
The consideration is still subject to the release of the 
escrow account. In 2022, Outokumpu recognized in the 
net result from the discontinued operations an 
impairment loss of EUR 33 million.
On April 1, 2023, Outokumpu announced that it had 
signed an agreement to divest the remaining Long 
Products operations in Degerfors and Storfors, Sweden 
to Cogne Acciai Speciali, a world leader in the 
production of long stainless steels and nickel alloys 
based in Italy. 
On August 1, 2023, Outokumpu announced that it has 
completed the divestment of the remaining Long 
Products business in Sweden. Outokumpu's plate 
operations in Degerfors are not affected by the 
divestment. The enterprise value of the transaction is 
EUR 12 million and it has a positive cash impact for 
Outokumpu. Outokumpu booked a loss of EUR 26 
million in the third quarter.
