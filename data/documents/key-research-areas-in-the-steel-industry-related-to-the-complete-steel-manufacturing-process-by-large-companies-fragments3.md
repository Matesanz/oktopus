## Advanced Manufacturing Techniques
This includes research into new manufacturing methods such as 3D printing with steel, which could revolutionize how steel products are designed and produced.

## Hydrogen-Based Steelmaking
Exploring the use of hydrogen as a replacement for carbon-based reducing agents in steelmaking is a growing area of research. Hydrogen has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from steel production.

## Utilization of By-Products
Developing new ways to use by-products of the steelmaking process, such as slag and dust, in other applications to reduce waste and create additional revenue streams.
