## Slag Utilization
Slag, a byproduct of the steelmaking process, is increasingly being repurposed. It can be used in construction materials, road building, and as a raw material in cement manufacturing, thus reducing waste and the need for virgin materials in these industries.

## Heat Recovery Systems:
Large steel companies often employ heat recovery systems to capture and reuse the heat generated in various processes. For example, the heat from sinter plants and blast furnaces can be recovered to produce steam and electricity, improving overall energy efficiency.

## Water Recycling
Water is used extensively in the steel industry for cooling and cleaning. Companies are now implementing advanced water treatment and recycling systems to minimize water consumption and reduce the environmental impact of water discharge.
