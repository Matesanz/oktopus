Financial position and cash flow
Operating cash flow turned negative in the third quarter of 
2023 and amounted to EUR -11 million (EUR 238 million, 
incl. discontinued operations). A significant change in the 
operating cash flow was driven by lower profitability and 
higher paid taxes. For January-September 2023 operating 
cash flow amounted to EUR 89 million (EUR 489 million, 
incl. discontinued operations). 
In the third quarter, net working capital decreased by EUR 
29 million (increase of EUR 147 million, incl. discontinued 
operations). The change in net working capital was driven 
by normal seasonality with lower deliveries. During 
January-September of 2023, the net working capital 
increase was EUR 143 million, compared to EUR 816 
million in the reference period.
Inventories decreased during the third quarter and stood 
at EUR 1,722 million at the end of September (June 30, 
2023: EUR 1,845 million, December 31, 2022: EUR 1,783 
million). The inventory decrease in the third quarter was 
EUR 123 million and EUR 61 million in January-
September of 2023. The decrease in the third quarter was 
driven by both lower volumes and lower metal prices.
Capital expenditure was EUR 31 million in the third 
quarter (EUR 37 million) and EUR 84 million in the 
January-September of 2023 (EUR 98 million). Annual 
capital expenditure for 2023 is limited to EUR 170 million.
Net debt increased slightly during the third quarter and 
amounted to EUR 29 million at the end of September 
(June 30, 2023: EUR -9 million, December 31, 2022: EUR 
-10 million, incl. discontinued operations). In the first 
quarter, the completion of the divestment of the majority 
of the Long Products business had a EUR 100 million 
positive impact on net debt, while the dividend payment of 
EUR 152 million increased net debt in the second quarter. 
Gearing amounted to 0.7% at the end of September 
(June 30, 2023: -0.2%, December 31, 2022: -0.3%, incl. 
discontinued operations). 
Net financial expenses in the third quarter amounted to 
EUR 15 million (EUR 17 million) and interest expenses 
EUR 15 million (EUR 11 million).
Net financial expenses in January-September 2023 
decreased to EUR 31 million (EUR 53 million) driven by 
higher interest income, lower loan related fees and 
market price impact. Interest expenses increased to EUR 
46 million (EUR 32 million), mainly due to overall higher 
interest rate environment.
Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 367 million 
at the end of September (June 30, 2023: EUR 409 million, 
December 31, 2022: EUR 644 million, incl. discontinued 
operations) and overall liquidity reserves EUR 1.2 billion 
(June 30, 2023: 1.2 billion, December 31, 2022: EUR 1.4 
billion). In the second quarter, Outokumpu prepaid EUR 
141 million of the remaining outstanding pension loans. 
On September 30, 2023, Outokumpu had a total of EUR 
800 million of outstanding committed credit facilities, 
which were fully unutilized. At the end of the third quarter, 
Outokumpu extended its current EUR 700 million 
multicurrency revolving credit facility by one year and it 
will mature in February 2027.
