Market development
According to CRU’s latest estimates (August 2023), the 
global apparent consumption of stainless steel flat 
products increased by 4.2% in the third quarter of 2023 
compared to the same period last year. While demand 
dropped in EMEA and Americas by 11.7% and 6.0%, 
respectively, demand in APAC rose by 8.5%. The market 
remained muted due to inflation and missing signs of a 
real demand recovery. Inventories were still being 
reduced from elevated levels. Consumers merely shared 
a wait-and-see attitude due to uncertainties in further 
demand and price development.
Compared to the second quarter of 2023, global apparent 
consumption of stainless steel flat products decreased by 
1.5% in the third quarter of 2023. This effect was driven 
by a decrease of 0.8% in APAC region and 6.3% in 
EMEA, whereas apparent consumption increased by 
1.0% in the US.
While the European market was muted over the summer 
period, the Americas market proved more resilient and 
stable. Recovery in the Chinese market is yet to 
materialize as governmental stimulus has only limited 
impact. Consumer confidence remains lackluster. 
CRU expects global apparent consumption of stainless 
steel flat products to increase by 2.9% in the fourth 
quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter, driven by 
an increase in APAC and the US by 1.3% and 2.4%, 
respectively. After the de-stocking cycle in Europe has 
come to an end, apparent consumption in EMEA is 
expected to increase by 12.9%, while a recovery in real 
demand is yet to come.
Compared to last year´s fourth quarter, apparent 
consumption is expected to increase by 1.1%. This 
results from an increase in EMEA of 9.6% and the US of 
10.3%. APAC, however, shows a decrease of 1.1%.
Having adjusted their figures on global apparent 
consumption downwards, CRU estimates that total global 
apparent consumption of stainless steel flat products in 
2023 will remain at the previous year's level, showing a 
very minor decrease of 0.4%. However, in EMEA 
apparent consumption of stainless steel flat products is 
estimated to decline by 15.6% in 2023 compared to the 
previous year.
