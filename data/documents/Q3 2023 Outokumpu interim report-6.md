Strategy execution
Outokumpu launched its three-phased strategy in 
November 2020. In the first phase the aim was to de-
risk the company by the end of 2022. This was 
completed six months ahead of schedule. As a result, 
Outokumpu started the second phase in July 2022, and 
this phase will run until the end of 2025. 
In the second phase of the strategy, the aim is to 
strengthen Outokumpu's core. The company aims to 
improve its EBITDA run-rate by an additional EUR 200 
million and maintain a net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
ratio below 1.0 in normal market conditions. 
The second phase is focused on three key priorities: 
sustainability, growth from productivity, and customer-
focused steering. Outokumpu remains committed to 
capital discipline, limiting its capital expenditure to EUR 
600 million over the next three years, while also 
increasing its focus on shareholder returns.
For the second phase, Outokumpu launched two 
customer-differentiated strategies for business area 
Europe. The company aims to strengthen cost 
leadership in high-volume stainless steel products and 
global market leadership in advanced products. In 
business area Americas, the initial aim is to improve 
capacity by 80 kilotons with small investments as 
announced in June 2022. In business area 
Ferrochrome, carbon neutrality is a strategic priority. 
Outokumpu has completed a total of 226 projects 
towards the EBITDA run-rate improvement target in 
2023, of which 47 were completed in the third quarter. 
The company has a continuous improvement pipeline 
of more than 1,000 projects spanning phase II of the 
strategy, with more than 300 projects in the 
implementation stage.
Outokumpu improved its EBITDA run-rate by EUR 70 
million in the third quarter of 2023. This translates into a 
cumulative EBITDA run-rate improvement of EUR 152 
million since the start of the second phase. Outokumpu 
remains fully on course to achieve the EUR 200 million 
EBITDA run-rate improvement target by the end of year 
2025.
The projects that contributed to the EBITDA run-rate 
improvement in the third quarter were related to the 
new steering model in business area Europe. 
Especially in the commodity business, Outokumpu has 
been able to improve its steering and thereby benefit 
from being more agile while facing challenging market 
conditions. Moreover, there have been good results 
from supply chain initiatives in business area Americas 
such as by firmly enlarging the share of rail transport 
instead of trucks, which also contributes to 
Outokumpu’s sustainability targets. 
Outokumpu is a significant user of energy and this has 
an impact on the company's costs as well as emissions. 
As sustainability is at the core of the strategy, 
Outokumpu has set an ambitious target to improve 
energy efficiency by 8% across the group by the end of 
2024 compared to the January–September 2022 level. 
This corresponds to energy savings of around 600 
GWh. At the end of the third quarter, Outokumpu has 
already achieved a run-rate improvement of 126 GWh 
in context of energy consumption, resulting in savings 
of about EUR 9 million.
Outokumpu has begun preparations for the third phase 
of its strategy, which will start in 2026 and most likely 
require new investments. On August 3, 2023, the 
company announced that it explores options to 
strengthen its position in the U.S. as part of phase three 
strategic preparations. The company’s focus in the third 
phase will be to strengthen its market position further 
and develop more globally diversified operations 
including Americas expansion, European 
competitiveness, value-chain integration and 
sustainability leadership along with the possible biocoke 
investment.
Outokumpu is currently conducting a feasibility study 
where it is exploring options for its hot rolling 
arrangements and evaluating a possible cold rolling 
capacity expansion in Calvert, Alabama. One possible 
option for the company is to build its own hot rolling mill.
Outokumpu has progressed with its decarbonization 
journey. On November 7, after the reporting period, 
Outokumpu announced it is expanding collaboration 
with CRONIMET to take circularity to new heights and 
to secure access to high-quality scrap near 
Outokumpu's sites in Europe. Outokumpu has signed 
an agreement to acquire a 10% minority interest in 
CRONIMET North-East GmbH, the holding company for 
CRONIMET’s Northeastern business in Europe. In 
September, Outokumpu signed a letter of intent with 
Greenland Resources Inc. to strengthen the future 
supply chain of low-emission high-quality molybdenum. 
In June, Outokumpu acquired a 9.9% share of FPX 
Nickel to strengthen the supply chain of sustainable 
nickel.
