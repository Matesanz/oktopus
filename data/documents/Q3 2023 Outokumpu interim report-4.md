Results
Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2022
Outokumpu's sales in the third quarter of 2023 
decreased to EUR 1,531 million (EUR 2,339 million). 
Adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 51 million 
(EUR 304 million) and the decrease compared to the 
reference period was driven by a substantially weaker 
market environment, especially in Europe. As a result of 
lower profitability, ROCE for the rolling 12 months was 
5.3% (26.8%). 
In the third quarter of 2023, total stainless steel 
deliveries were 9% lower compared to the reference 
period. The significant decrease in profitability was 
mainly driven by substantially lower realized prices for 
stainless steel in Europe. Realized prices for stainless 
steel decreased also in Americas and the ferrochrome 
sales price was lower. Profitability was, however, 
supported by decreased variable costs, mainly due to 
lower electricity and ferrosilicon prices. Raw material-
related inventory and metal derivative losses amounted 
to EUR 27 million (losses of EUR 107 million). Other 
operations and intra-group items’ adjusted EBITDA 
totaled EUR 5 million (EUR 7 million). Both net result 
and earnings per share turned negative for the quarter 
and were driven by weak EBITDA development. Net 
result was EUR -55 million in the third quarter of 2023 
(EUR 207 million).
Q3 2023 compared to Q2 2023
Outokumpu’s sales decreased to EUR 1,531 million in 
the third quarter of 2023 (Q2/2023: EUR 1,911 million) 
and adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 51 million 
(Q2/2023: EUR 190 million). The decrease in adjusted 
EBITDA was mainly driven by the challenging market 
environment in Europe. As a result of lower profitability, 
ROCE for the rolling 12 months was 5.3% (11.4%). 
In the third quarter, total stainless steel deliveries 
decreased by 11% from the second quarter, in line with 
the seasonal pattern. In addition to decreased volumes, 
profitability was also negatively impacted by lower 
realized prices for stainless steel in both Europe and 
Americas as well as the lower ferrochrome sales price. 
Positive impact in the third quarter compared to the 
previous quarter came from lower costs in business 
areas Europe and Ferrochrome. Raw material-related 
inventory and metal derivative losses increased to EUR 
27 million in the third quarter (Q2/2023: losses of EUR 
12 million). Other operations and intra-group items’ 
adjusted EBITDA totaled EUR 5 million (Q2/2023: EUR 
-8 million). Net result in the third quarter was EUR -55 
million (Q2/2023: EUR 89 million).
