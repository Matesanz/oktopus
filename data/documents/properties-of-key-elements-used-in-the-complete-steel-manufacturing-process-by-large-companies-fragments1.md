## Properties of Key Elements Used in the Complete Steel Manufacturing Process by Large Companies
    In the steel manufacturing process, several elements are crucial, each having specific properties that make them essential for steel production:

## Iron (Fe):
  - **Magnetic Properties**: Iron is naturally magnetic, which is important in various applications.
- **Reactivity**: Iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water, forming rust (iron oxide).
- **Malleability and Ductility**: Pure iron is soft and can be shaped easily, making it suitable for alloying.

## Carbon (C):

- **Alloying Element**: In steel, carbon is used as an alloying element. Its content in steel determines the hardness and strength.
- **Form**: In steelmaking, carbon is primarily used in the form of coke.
