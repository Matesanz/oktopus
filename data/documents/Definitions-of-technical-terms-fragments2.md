The Tapio model is not limited to a simplistic view of these two variables; it can be broken down into different factors such as energy intensity, economic structure, and energy efficiency. This decomposition allows for a more detailed understanding of the components driving the decoupling or coupling between energy consumption and economic growth.

A practical application of the Tapio Decoupling Model is found in the industry, where it can be used to analyze how energy efficiency evolves in key economic sectors. For example, it has been applied in the iron and steel industry in China to examine this relationship. Similarly, the model plays a significant role in broader contexts, such as Chile's transition towards natural CO2-eq sinks and heating and cooling systems based on renewable technologies. In these cases, the model helps measure the disconnection between economic growth and energy consumption and identify how economic growth can be achieved with a lower energy impact.

In conclusion, the Tapio Decoupling Model is a valuable tool for analyzing and understanding the relationship between economic growth and energy consumption. Its focus on measuring the disconnection and identifying the contributing factors to the decoupling or coupling of these variables makes it essential for assessing and promoting energy efficiency in different sectors and economic contexts. It can be applied in the industry to analyze the evolution of energy efficiency and to identify the factors that contribute to the decoupling or coupling of energy consumption and economic growth.
