## Limestone (Calcium Carbonate, CaCO₃):

- **Flux Properties**: Limestone acts as a flux in the blast furnace, aiding in impurity removal.
- **Thermal Decomposition**: It decomposes to lime (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) at high temperatures, with lime combining with silica impurities to form slag.

## Oxygen (O):

- ***Reactivity**: Oxygen is used in the Basic Oxygen Steelmaking process to remove excess carbon and other impurities.
- **Oxidizing Agent**: Acts as an oxidizing agent, facilitating the conversion of pig iron into steel.

## Chromium (Cr):

- **Corrosion Resistance**: When added to steel, it significantly increases corrosion and oxidation resistance.
- **Hardness and Tensile Strength**: Enhances hardness and tensile strength.
