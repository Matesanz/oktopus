## Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS)
In the BOF process, oxygen is blown into molten iron to reduce carbon content and produce steel. The reaction between oxygen and carbon in the iron generates a significant amount of heat, which helps maintain the temperature of the molten metal. However, external energy sources, usually derived from electricity or natural gas, are also used to control the temperature and speed of the process.

## Secondary Steelmaking
Secondary steelmaking processes like ladle furnace refining and vacuum degassing require electrical energy. These processes are used for precise control of steel composition and temperature, necessitating consistent and controlled energy input.

## Continuous Casting
Continuous casting involves solidifying molten steel into semi-finished forms. This process is less energy-intensive compared to earlier stages, but still requires thermal energy for maintaining the molten steel's temperature and electrical energy for the equipment operation.
