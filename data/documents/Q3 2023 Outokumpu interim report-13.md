Sustainability 
Outokumpu’s vision is to be the customer’s first choice in 
sustainable stainless steel, and the company's purpose 
is working towards a world that lasts forever. 
Sustainability at Outokumpu is founded on good 
governance and three pillars—environmental, economic, 
and social—which all need to be in balance. The 
company is a signatory to the United Nations Global 
Compact. Outokumpu is committed to the United 
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, with a focus 
on the following six objectives: affordable and clean 
energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, 
innovation and infrastructure; responsible consumption 
and production; climate action; and partnerships for the 
goals. These goals were the result of a materiality 
analysis that was conducted in 2021 and Outokumpu 
plans to review these as part of a double materiality 
analysis that will be completed in the fourth quarter.
In the past, Outokumpu has operated mines both in 
Finland and elsewhere. At the beginning of the 2000s, 
the company decided to focus on stainless steel. 
Currently, Outokumpu has only one active mine, the 
Kemi chrome mine, which is an integral part of our 
stainless steel production. The Kemi mine is the only 
chrome mine in the European Union, and the carbon 
footprint of Outokumpu's ferrochrome operations is 
estimated to be 67% lower than the global industry 
average. Outokumpu has set a target to reach carbon 
neutrality in Kemi mine by 2025.
Outokumpu is the only stainless steel producer in the 
world with Science-Based Target initiative approved 
climate targets aligned with 1.5 °C degrees. That means  
Outokumpu is committed to reducing its direct (Scope 1), 
indirect (Scope 2) and value chain (Scope 3) emission 
intensity by 42% by 2030 compared to 2016 baseline. 
Outokumpu's sustainability targets also include 
increased recycling rate and energy efficiency, improved 
safety and organizational health, diversity, equity and 
inclusion, supply chain sustainability and zero 
environmental incidents. All of Outokumpu’s production 
sites are certified according to ISO 14001.  
During the third quarter of 2023, Outokumpu launched 
Outokumpu Circle Green® customer cases with Fissler, 
thyssenkrupp Materials Processing Europe and Purem 
by Eberspaecher to support industries in reducing their 
carbon footprint. To strengthen the circular economy 
across the stainless steel industry, Outokumpu also 
introduced new supplier collaborations to the Inner 
Circle® initiative to increase visibility of the circular 
economy and to leverage existing efficient supply 
chains. Outokumpu's Kemi mine also achieved a third of 
its target of becoming carbon neutral by 2025 by 
switching to renewable fuels during the third quarter. 
Outokumpu has been a member of ResponsibleSteel 
since 2019. ResponsibleSteel is a standard that was 
developed to recognize steel sites that are being 
operated in a responsible manner with a focus on the 
most material ESG issues identified and agreed upon by 
ResponsibleSteel members and stakeholders. 
Outokumpu completed Stage 1 and 2 audits for all 
European manufacturing sites with no major non-
conformities.
Outokumpu has an ambitious energy efficiency program, 
in which the target is to improve energy efficiency by 8% 
by the end of 2024 across Outokumpu's operations from 
the January–September 2022 baseline. This effort would 
correspond to energy savings equivalent to the annual 
electricity usage of 15,000 households. At the end of Q3 
2023, Outokumpu has already achieved a run-rate 
improvement of 126 GWh in the context of energy 
consumption, resulting in savings of about EUR 9 
million. During third quarter, four additional investment 
projects were approved to improve energy efficiency.   
Outokumpu is improving its energy efficiency by 
optimizing energy consumption, minimizing energy 
losses during material processing and continually 
enhancing overall yield. Since the start of the program, 
Outokumpu has accomplished improvements in 
recovering and re-utilizing excess heat in its mills and 
continues to identify additional potential improvements. 
The company continues its efforts in implementing over 
35 investment initiatives.
Outokumpu met the set targets for sustainability key 
performance indicators (KPIs) in the third quarter for 
material recycling and emission intensity. Recycled 
material content remained high and was 94% for the 
rolling 12 months for the entire group. During the third 
quarter, there were two environmental incidents with 
zero permit breaches concerning Outokumpu 
operations. These were reported to the relevant 
authorities.
Safety performance measured as the total recordable 
incident frequency rate (TRIFR) was 1.7, slightly 
weakened from the previous quarter but remained at a 
world-class level (Q2/2023: 1.2; Q3/2022: 2.7). In 
January-September 2023, TRIFR was 1.6 which is an 
improvement compared to last year (2022: 1.9).
During the third quarter the focus remained on the safety 
network and the AI robotic deployment to reduce the 
exposure of employees to hazardous areas. The roll-out 
of a harmonized reporting tool to several pilot sites is on 
schedule. To further improve the safety performance the 
scope of the investigations to root-cause level was 
enlarged. Throughout the fourth quarter the focus will be 
on the finalization of the safety projects.
