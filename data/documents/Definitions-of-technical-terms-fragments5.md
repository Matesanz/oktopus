## Verhulst Grey Model
The Verhulst Grey Model is a mathematical model used to predict the behavior of a data series over time. This model was developed by the Belgian mathematician Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst in the 19th century and is used in various fields, such as biology, economics, and engineering.

The model is based on Verhulst's nonlinear differential equation, which describes the growth of a population in terms of time and the environmental carrying capacity.

The Verhulst Grey Model is used to predict the behavior of a data series over time, based on the extrapolation of historical data to predict future behavior.

In summary, the Verhulst Grey Model is a mathematical model used to predict the behavior of a data

 series over time, based on Verhulst's nonlinear differential equation to describe the growth of a population in terms of time and environmental carrying capacity.
