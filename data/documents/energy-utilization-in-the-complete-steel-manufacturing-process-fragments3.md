## Primary Forming
Processes like rolling, where semi-finished steel is shaped into final products, are significant consumers of mechanical energy. This energy is primarily derived from electric motors that drive the rolling mills.

## Heat Treatment and Finishing
Heat treatment processes such as annealing, tempering, and quenching require thermal energy to alter the physical and chemical properties of steel. The finishing processes may also consume electrical energy, especially for operations like cutting, welding, or coating.

## Quality Control and Testing
While not as energy-intensive as the manufacturing stages, these processes still require energy for operating testing and measuring equipment, usually electrical energy.

### Conclusion
    Overall, the steel manufacturing process is heavily reliant on thermal energy (primarily from burning coal and natural gas) and electrical energy. The industry constantly seeks ways to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, including the adoption of renewable energy sources and the development of more energy-efficient technologies.
