# Resource Reutilization in the Complete Steel Manufacturing Process by Large Companies

    Large companies in the steel industry are increasingly focusing on resource reutilization to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact. Here's how they are incorporating resource reutilization in the steel manufacturing process:

## Scrap Steel Recycling
One of the most significant aspects of resource reutilization is the recycling of scrap steel. In the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) process, which is an alternative to the traditional blast furnace method, scrap steel is melted and recycled to produce new steel. This not only reduces the need for raw materials like iron ore but also saves energy.

## Energy Recovery from Waste Gases
Companies capture and reuse the waste gases from the blast furnace and coke ovens. These gases are rich in carbon monoxide and can be used as a fuel source in other parts of the plant, such as power generation or heating, thus reducing the dependency on external energy sources.
