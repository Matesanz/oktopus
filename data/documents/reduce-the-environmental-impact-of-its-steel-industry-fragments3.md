## Use of Constructed Wetlands for Wastewater Treatment
Constructed wetlands have been employed to treat wastewater by removing contaminants such as suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, and phosphorus. This process is accomplished through filtration, absorption, and plant uptake, known as phytoremediation. This method is notably more economical than conventional civil engineering technologies​​.

## Pyrolysis of Wetland Plants
To further improve sustainability, the thesis examines the use of pyrolysis for the wetland plants used in wastewater treatment. This process can replace fossil fuels with a renewable, CO2-neutral energy source. Pyrolysis serves both as an end-use for treated biomass and a means to close the loop in the steel manufacturing process, thus introducing another decomposer role into the ecosystem​​.

## Conclusion
    These strategies represent a comprehensive approach to improving the environmental sustainability of the Chinese steel industry, emphasizing water and energy conservation, waste treatment efficiency, and the incorporation of eco-friendly practices.
