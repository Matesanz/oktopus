## Raw Material Acquisition
The primary raw materials used in steel production are iron ore, coal, and limestone. Iron ore is the source of iron, coal is used for its carbon content, and limestone is a flux to remove impurities.

## Coking
Coal is converted into coke by heating it in the absence of oxygen. This process removes impurities like water, coal gas, and coal tar. Coke is a porous, hard black rock of concentrated carbon that is essential for the blast furnace process.

## Sintering and Pelletizing
Iron ore, which might be in the form of fines, is agglomerated into larger pieces to improve efficiency in the blast furnace. Sintering involves heating iron ore fines along with flux and coke fines, forming a porous mass. Pelletizing, on the other hand, involves forming small balls of iron ore and baking them to harden.
