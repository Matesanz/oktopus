Market
•
Global ferrochrome market remained weak 
throughout Q3 2023. Inventory levels were 
still at a relatively high level after the first half 
of the year in slowing market conditions. 
Chrome ore market continued to be strong, 
especially in China. The global ferrochrome 
production has been cut and, therefore, 
oversupply is limited and market prices have 
remained on a decent level.
