## Blast Furnace Ironmaking
In the blast furnace, iron ore is reduced to molten iron. Coke serves as both a fuel and a reducing agent, while limestone helps to remove impurities. Hot air blasts into the furnace, causing the coke to burn and generate the high temperatures needed to melt the ore. The chemical reactions in the furnace produce molten iron and slag, which is a byproduct.

## Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS)
The molten iron from the blast furnace is then transferred to a steelmaking vessel, usually a Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF). Here, it is converted into steel by blowing oxygen through the iron. The oxygen reacts with the carbon in the iron, producing carbon dioxide and steel.
## Secondary Steelmaking
This stage involves refining the composition of the steel. Techniques like ladle furnace refining, vacuum degassing, and argon stirring are used to remove impurities, control the temperature, and achieve the desired chemical composition.
