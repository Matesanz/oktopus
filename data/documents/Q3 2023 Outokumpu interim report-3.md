President & CEO Heikki Malinen
The third quarter of 2023 reflects the cyclical nature of 
the stainless steel business. We experienced a very 
challenging market environment in Europe, but thanks to 
our geopolitically diversified asset portfolio and a solid 
performance in the Americas, we delivered EUR 51 
million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. Our 
stainless steel deliveries decreased by 11% from the 
second quarter, in line with the seasonal pattern.
For business area Europe, the market environment was 
even more difficult than during the pandemic. Stainless 
steel deliveries decreased from the second quarter and 
adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR -29 million. We are 
on a journey to improve our competitiveness in Europe 
and have taken prompt actions. Today, we announced 
that we are streamlining our operations in Germany to 
ensure that we are utilizing our assets in the most 
efficient way.
For business area Americas, the market environment 
remained more favorable, and we continued to generate 
solid results. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 53 
million, while stainless steel deliveries decreased 
compared to the second quarter. Our strategic plans in 
Calvert, Alabama are progressing well and the feasibility 
study to assess both our hot rolling and cold rolling 
operations is ongoing.
In business area Ferrochrome, third-quarter adjusted 
EBITDA amounted to EUR 21 million. We reached a 
great milestone in October when we had the 
inauguration of the Kemi mine expansion. We have now 
ensured the supply of chrome ore until at least the end 
of the 2040s. We are also taking determined steps 
toward our aim that the Kemi mine will become the first 
carbon-neutral mine globally by 2025.
Within decarbonization, our focus has been on energy 
efficiency improvements. These are crucial for energy-
intensive industries such as stainless steel as they will 
reduce both our emissions and costs. We aim to improve 
our energy efficiency by 8% by the end of 2024 and 
have now achieved over 20% of that target, resulting in 
EUR 9 million savings. Our teams have provided 
innovative solutions to drive this great improvement. It is 
already now evident that we will overachieve our 8% 
target but it will take more time.
As part of our long-term ambition to decarbonize the 
company, we have taken strong actions to support our 
sustainability leadership. Our business is based on the 
circular economy and scrap is our most important raw 
material. 94% of all our raw material is recycled, and this 
is a critical factor in keeping our carbon footprint the 
lowest in the industry. Today, we announced we will 
acquire a 10% share of a large scrap dealer 
CRONIMET’s Northeastern business. By acquiring a 
share, we will strengthen our long-term partnership 
further and ensure access to high quality scrap near our 
European sites. 
Earlier, we signed a letter of intent with Greenland 
Resources Inc. to strengthen our future supply of low-
emission high-quality molybdenum. We have also 
acquired a share of FPX Nickel to ensure access to low-
carbon nickel in the future. All these actions are part of 
our strategic plans to strengthen our value chain 
integration to ensure a sufficient future supply of critical 
raw materials with a low carbon footprint.
The market environment in Europe has been 
challenging, but it seems that the bottom is now behind 
us, and we have already seen some positive signals. 
Market recovery, however, is expected to take time.
I want to thank our employees for their resilience and 
dedication. Stainless steel is a volatile industry, but I am 
confident that as a team we will overcome the turbulent 
times. Our strong balance sheet and good liquidity will 
carry us through the cycle and ensure that we will create 
value also in more challenging conditions.
Outlook for Q4 2023
Group stainless steel deliveries in the fourth quarter are 
expected to increase by 0-10% compared to the third 
quarter as we see some recovery in Europe.
The planned maintenance break in business area 
Ferrochrome is expected to have an approximately   
EUR 10 million negative impact on the business area's 
adjusted EBITDA.
With current raw material prices, some raw material 
related inventory and metal derivative losses are 
expected to be realized in the fourth quarter.
Guidance for Q4 2023: 
Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 is 
expected to be at a similar or higher level compared to 
the third quarter.
