Risks and uncertainties
Outokumpu is exposed to various risks and uncertainties 
that may have an adverse impact on its business and 
operations. The adverse development of global 
economy, geopolitical tensions including Israel-Hamas 
war and the continued war in Ukraine have increased 
the risks and uncertainties to which Outokumpu is 
exposed. However, the company has taken prompt 
measures to manage and control these risks.
The global economic outlook remains weak with 
intensified challenges in the operating environment. The 
uncertainties mainly relate to the development of the 
global economy, persistent high inflation level, increased 
interest rates, the possible consequences from the 
geopolitical tensions and China’s economic growth, all of 
which could impact Outokumpu's operating environment, 
business, and stainless steel demand.
Electricity market prices have declined throughout the 
year but volatility remains, which could possibly 
negatively impact Outokumpu's costs. During the third 
quarter, the nuclear power plant Olkiluoto-3 in Finland 
continued to contribute and balance the electricity 
market in Finland. The electricity area prices in Finland 
were affected by limitations in transmission capacity 
between northern Sweden and Finland as well as 
unplanned outages of Finnish nuclear production and 
low wind. Possible increases in the price of electricity 
would mainly affect business area Ferrochrome, due to 
the high electricity needed in ferrochrome production. 
Gas availability in Germany remained sufficient during 
the third quarter with limited uncertainties for the winter 
period. The uncertainties are mainly related to increased 
energy price sensitivity to adverse events in the 
geopolitical situation. Gas availability is considered 
adequate for the winter period due to continued high gas 
storage levels in Germany. Further possible sanctions or 
disruptions in the natural gas supply could affect the 
prices or availability of gas for Outokumpu’s operations 
in Europe. Outokumpu acquires energy gases from the 
European market, for which Russia is one of the indirect 
suppliers.
Outokumpu does not purchase any scrap or nickel of 
Russian origin for its operations. The risk of possible 
disruptions in its raw material supply chain due to 
sanctions is considered to be limited. At the end of the 
third quarter, indirect supply from Russia still exists for a 
very limited amount of raw material, and the company is 
demanding that its supplier finds alternative sources 
globally. 
The company remains exposed to risks related to 
volatile metal prices, especially nickel. Volatile metal 
prices may impact Outokumpu’s result, among other 
financial risks.
In addition, cyber security threats and dependencies on 
critical suppliers expose Outokumpu to the risk of 
operational disruptions and additional costs. A key 
critical supplier dependency in this regard exists in 
Calvert, Alabama in the US where Outokumpu procures 
hot rolling services from an external party. There is an 
agreement in place until 2036, which, as of October 1, 
2023 can be terminated by either party with a 36 months’ 
notice period.
The EU safeguard measures, renewed in June by the 
European Commission, are in place until June 2024 
which decreases the risk of a sudden import surge. In 
August, the anti-circumvention investigation on cold 
rolled stainless steel from Indonesia was initiated and 
this is expected to immediately decrease the risk of 
imports from Taiwan, Turkey, and Vietnam until at least 
April 2024.
Outokumpu Oyj was in May 2023 joined into arbitration 
proceedings over a dispute between Fennovoima and 
RAOS Project Oy related to the termination of the EPC 
(Engineering, Procurement and Construction) agreement 
for a nuclear power plant. Outokumpu disputes the 
existence of any contractual relation, obligation, or 
arbitration agreement between Outokumpu and RAOS 
Project Oy.
