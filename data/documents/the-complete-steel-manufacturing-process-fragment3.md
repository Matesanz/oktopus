## Continuous Casting
The steel is then cast into solid forms. In continuous casting, the molten steel is poured into a water-cooled mold, solidifying into a semi-finished form like slabs, blooms, or billets.
## Primary Forming
These semi-finished forms are then processed into various shapes. Rolling is the most common method, where the steel is passed through a series of rollers to produce sheets, beams, and other shapes.
## Heat Treatment and Finishing
Steel is often heat-treated to alter its properties, such as increasing hardness or strength. Finally, it undergoes finishing processes like coating, galvanizing, or painting to enhance its resistance to corrosion and wear.
